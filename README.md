###Basic Idea/Motivation
* The idea is to allow people to connect to a wifi hotspot and then immediately be able to simulate shitty mobile network connections.
* Lets developers easily test application performance with on slow connection in mind
* Relates to “mobile first” thinking by acknowledging “mobile first” means connections that are not always as reliable/speedy/generally good (i.e. 💩).

###Specification

* Ability to introduce extra:
 * Latency (delay)
 * Packet loss
 * Bandwidth limitations
 * Per device address throttling → i.e. web interface such that you can go and adjust the setting for your client only.
